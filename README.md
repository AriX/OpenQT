OpenQT
======

This AppleScript detects HTML5 video playing in Safari or Chrome and opens it in QuickTime Player.

Use as an Alfred Workflow, an Automator Service, or in your own scripts and applications.

There are some issues that I haven't sorted out yet:
* The script does not pick up videos using <embed> or <object>
* QuickTime Player X seems to be unable to open some types of videos
* YouTube HTML videos don't work because they don't have a file extension
